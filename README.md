Number Guessing Game
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game repository! This is a simple, interactive game built using JavaScript that challenges users to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. It provides feedback after each guess to help the user adjust their next attempt.

Features
Random number generation: The game generates a random number within a given range (default: 1 to 100).
User Input: Players input their guesses, and the game provides feedback whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
Attempts Counter: The number of attempts is displayed to keep track of the user's progress.
Win Message: When the user guesses the correct number, they are congratulated with a win message.
How to Play
When the game starts, a random number between 1 and 100 is generated.
Enter a number in the input field and click the Guess button.
The game will provide feedback:
Too high: Your guess is higher than the random number.
Too low: Your guess is lower than the random number.
Correct!: Congratulations, you've guessed the correct number!
Keep guessing until you find the correct number.
